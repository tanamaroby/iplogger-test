## 📌 About

This is a simple IP logging and location tracker site built with Next.js. It displays your public IP address and fetches basic location data using IP-based geolocation.

It's primarily used as a **personal playground for learning**, testing tools like Playwright, Google Maps, and handling client-side data fetching in modern web apps.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- 🗺️ Add more detailed **geolocation** (lat/lng + map)
- 📍 Enable tracking of **specific IPs** (with user consent)
- 🔗 Allow **link forwarding** to help others discover their own IPs
- 📦 Store recent logs for debugging/testing (again, with consent)
- 🛠️ And many more features as it evolves
